# Bharat Navya — canonical handoff

Updated: 28 September 2026

Official branch: `design`

Official application: `frontend/`

Official UI implementation checkpoint: `2c01e52` (the parent checkpoint for this workspace-hygiene update)

Git identity: `itbharatnavya <314251907+itbharatnavya@users.noreply.github.com>`

This is the single continuation source of truth for current Bharat Navya product and visual work. Read it after `AGENTS.md`. `HANDOVER.md` is legacy engineering/setup context only; older UI experiments are archived under `archive/legacy-ui/` and must not be used as the implementation target.

## 1. Start here in a new session

1. Read `AGENTS.md`, then this file.
2. Confirm `git branch --show-current` is `design`.
3. Run `git status --short` before editing. Preserve unrelated dirty files.
4. Work in `frontend/`. Do not implement current UI work in the archive.
5. Use the project `frontend-design` and `impeccable` skills for visual/UI work; read each selected skill completely before acting.
6. Inspect the rendered browser state at desktop and mobile sizes. A passing build is not visual acceptance.
7. Stage only the files belonging to the current task. Push only to `origin/design` and never merge, rebase, or force-push another branch without explicit approval.

## 2. Official workspace map

| Path | Status | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `frontend/` | **Official / active** | Next.js 14 application. All current product-design implementation belongs here. |
| `backend/` | Active contract, normally out of scope | Express API and data contracts. Preserve unless backend work is explicitly requested. |
| `Website content (Feni)/` | Source material | Approved content PDFs. Do not edit or commit them as part of frontend work. |
| `archive/legacy-ui/vite-design-reference/` | **Frozen archive** | Former `Design/` Vite prototype, retained only for historical comparison. Never run, import, or implement product work here. |
| `archive/legacy-ui/root-vite-artifacts/` | Local ignored archive | Old root `dist/` and `node_modules/` artifacts moved out of the working root. Not a source tree. |
| `HANDOVER.md` | Legacy reference | Older setup/backend notes. It does not override this handoff. |

The current product is not the archived prototype. If an archived document conflicts with `frontend/`, `AGENTS.md`, or this handoff, the active `frontend/` code and this handoff win.

## 3. Git and working-tree state

- `design` and `origin/design` were aligned at `2c01e52` before this handoff/archive cleanup.
- The account configured in this checkout is `itbharatnavya`, as requested.
- Recent official checkpoints:
  - `2c01e52` — audit and unify frontend visual system
  - `9bbd41d` — complete visual direction across secondary pages
  - `3d404fc` — integrate Feni content across public frontend
  - `72b9fa4` — integrate live search suggestions
  - `aace218` — polish Bharat Navya frontend experience
- Pre-existing dirty files outside this handoff task include product/design documents, Feni PDFs, and backend JSON fixtures. They belong to prior/user work. Do not reset, replace, or sweep them into an unrelated commit.
- In particular, do not casually commit `backend/DB/*`, `Website content (Feni)/*`, `DESIGN.md`, `HANDOVER.md`, `MIGRATION-CAPABILITY-MATRIX.md`, `PRODUCT-DESIGN-MIGRATION.md`, or `frontend-design-guide.md` merely because they appear in `git status`.

## 4. Product boundary and data rules

- Public navigation is **Home, Directory, Recruitment**.
- Directory is one services-and-products discovery journey. Companies are the providers behind those listings, not a third listing type.
- Preserve existing authentication, search, inquiry, job, application, seller, employer, candidate, story/status, blog, and advertising contracts.
- Use live/API-generated companies, listings, products, jobs, blogs, statuses, ads, and genuine empty states. Do not replace them with convenient static fixtures.
- Statuses use the stories/status endpoint (`seller` for Directory, `employer` for Recruitment), never the blogs API. Blogs remain a separate content source.
- Do not call several interchangeable stories/blog endpoints at once to populate one surface.
- Do not imply checkout, guaranteed enquiries, instant capabilities after signup, or persisted success when the backend does not support it.
- Editorial language uses **“B2B platform,”** not “B2B marketplace.” Prefer “review and shortlist” over unsupported side-by-side comparison claims.

## 5. Binding visual direction

- Current direction: the Bharat Navya **Counter** system, translated into the active product rather than copied from the old prototype.
- Display type: **Anek Latin**. UI/body type: **Work Sans**.
- Core palette: indigo/blue hero, green Directory ownership, saffron action/Recruitment ownership, warm ivory/chalk surfaces, dark ink, cool raised workbench surfaces.
- Flat, intentional colour fields; no generic gradients.
- Ordinary buttons, inputs, cards, modals, panels, and section containers share the current rounded-edge system. Pills and circles are shape exceptions only when they have a semantic reason.
- Use shared tokens and primitives. Do not create page-specific header sizes, radii, gutters, search controls, or button systems to patch one screen.
- The shared public header must look and measure consistently on every route. Fix section spacing in the section, not by forking the header.
- CTA colour must contrast with its container. No blue-on-blue hero actions, hidden white text, or same-colour cards that disappear into the background.
- Keep section gaps consistent between hero, status/ad band, content, ads, and results. Avoid both touching containers and arbitrary one-off margins.
- Subtitles are optional. Do not add explanatory copy where the heading/control is already self-evident.
- Suggested-search chips are centred when they fit and horizontally scroll only when required.
- Mobile is a deliberate reading order, not compressed desktop columns. Selected listing/job detail expands with the clicked card rather than appearing as an unrelated container elsewhere.
- Promotions must be clearly labelled and visible without competing with the primary task. Media may never cover ad copy, CTA, or disclosure.

Primary live style sources:

- `frontend/app/globals.css`
- `frontend/app/counter-direction.css`
- `frontend/app/counter-soft-system.css`
- `frontend/app/counter-workspace.css`
- shared components under `frontend/components/`
- `frontend/docs/COUNTER_VISUAL_DIRECTION.md` when present

## 6. Completed product and UI work

### Shared system and full-surface audit

- The visual direction now covers public, authentication, profile, seller/employer/candidate, listing/product, job, workspace, admin, and create-product surfaces rather than only the landing pages.
- Legacy-looking route families were bridged into the current typography, palette, spacing, radius, control, and surface hierarchy.
- The latest audit checked 80 public/auth route states across desktop and mobile, plus 50 admin states and 64 workspace states, without hard render failures in the audited environment.
- Admin tables, toolbar controls, seller/employer workspaces, pricing admin calls, auth viewport fit, and overflow-prone secondary pages received targeted repairs in the latest checkpoint.
- Dropdowns and search suggestions were brought into the same visual language.

### Home `/`

- `HomeAgent` is the hero **Ask Navya** discovery/search experience. It is visually and conceptually distinct from a conventional listing search box.
- The compact suite layout has a smaller Navya card and right-side Directory, Recruitment, and Growth OS cards. Growth OS is marked **Coming soon**.
- Ask Navya opens a conversational modal. Its stack must remain above all page media while the page or modal scrolls.
- The separate bottom-right `ChatAssistant` remains. It is a future-purpose navigation/help assistant, icon-only while closed, named when open, and may show a subtle discovery nudge. Do not merge it with Ask Navya.
- Directory is green; Recruitment is saffron. Recruitment must not blend into the blue hero or become a black card.
- The former oversized “Clarity follows the whole decision” section is a smaller, focused journey rather than multiple competing cards.
- A clearly labelled promotional surface and current blog content remain intact.

### Directory home `/directory`

- Feni-approved page content is integrated while preserving live data sections.
- The hero search provides as-you-type suggestions and keyboard selection.
- Company statuses use `getStories("seller")` and remain visible as a truthful empty state when no active status exists.
- The post-hero band is 2:1: statuses on the left, boosted-company placement on the right; it stacks in that order on narrow screens.
- Service families, providers, products, journey, company insights, closing CTA, ads, and API listings remain present.

### Recruitment home `/recruitment`

- Feni-approved page content is integrated and role-family descriptions map to live API categories without renaming API labels/routes.
- The hero search provides as-you-type role/company suggestions and keyboard selection.
- Hiring statuses use `getStories("employer")`; blogs/updates are separate.
- The post-hero band mirrors Directory: 2:1 statuses plus boosted-employer/recruiter placement.
- Fresh roles, hiring companies, application journey, updates, closing profile section, ads, and live job behavior remain present.

### Directory results `/search`

- Services and products are consolidated into one results experience.
- Before selection, the listing ledger takes roughly two-thirds and filters take one-third; detail is not open by default.
- Selecting a listing opens the centre detail pane and compresses the ledger. On small screens detail expands inside the selected card.
- Basic filters are immediately visible; fuller filters remain available without a redundant second “Filters” heading.
- The search hero uses a distinguishable raised surface with a white field.
- The result promotion is separated by the shared gap. The desktop filter rail is shorter with a labelled ad below it.

### Recruitment results `/recruitment/jobs`

- Job hover/selection uses an outline/highlight rather than filling the whole card blue.
- Hero, promotion, and results use the shared gap.
- The desktop filter rail has a labelled recruitment ad below it; mobile retains the filter sheet without forcing the rail ad into the list.
- Mobile role detail expands within the selected role card.

### Detail, account, and operational routes

- Category/city, brand, collection, listing/product, seller/company, employer, job, candidate/profile, Create Product (`/sell`), post-job, pricing, login/register, admin, seller dashboard, and recruitment dashboard routes were included in the secondary-page visual pass.
- Login and registration are designed to fit a normal desktop viewport with balanced top/bottom space and no unnecessary page scroll; re-check at actual viewport sizes after auth changes.
- Seller/company hero media and metrics use intentional spacing rather than touching.
- Feni content was integrated into Home, Directory, Recruitment, About, Navya Blog, Pricing, Login, and Register while preserving behavior and localization boundaries.

## 7. Verification evidence and how to re-check

Evidence recorded for the latest official checkpoint:

- `npm run validate:design` passed.
- `npx tsc --noEmit` passed.
- `npm run build` passed.
- `git diff --check` passed.
- Public/auth, admin, and workspace route matrices were rendered at desktop and mobile widths without hard failures.
- Localhost was restored on port 3000 after build/audit work.

Run these from `frontend/` after changes:

```bash
npm run validate:design
npx tsc --noEmit
npm run build
```

Then run from the repository root:

```bash
git diff --check
```

Important: stop the Next dev server before `next build`; both use `.next` and can corrupt or hide runtime state. Restart the dev server after a build, then inspect the real pages at approximately 1440×900 and 390×844. Check focus states, keyboard navigation, menus, modals, dropdowns, text wrap, clipping, horizontal overflow, sticky/fixed controls, empty/loading/error states, and long API content.

## 8. Local runtime

Backend:

```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

Frontend:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

Expected local URLs:

- Frontend: `http://localhost:3000`
- Backend: `http://localhost:4000`
- Browser calls `/api/*` through the frontend proxy; port 3000 is the site, port 4000 is the API.

Verify both before judging missing statuses, blogs, jobs, listings, ads, or suggestions.

## 9. Deployment truth

- Frontend project: `https://bharat-navya.vercel.app`.
- Do **not** assume Vercel represents the latest source checkpoint without verifying the deployment SHA.
- Production is not fully functional while `/api/*` is configured to reach `localhost:4000`; Vercel cannot reach a backend running on the local Mac.
- Missing production statuses, blogs, jobs, listings, ads, or other API sections are therefore a backend-hosting/configuration issue, not permission to replace them with static data.
- Hosting remains a separate decision: deploy the backend publicly (for example Railway) or deliberately configure a Vercel-compatible backend, then set `BACKEND_URL` and re-run production smoke tests.
- Do not claim production acceptance until public API routes and authenticated/live-data flows are verified.

## 10. Remaining work / next priorities

1. Decide and implement public backend hosting, then configure `BACKEND_URL` for Vercel.
2. Verify the production deployment is built from the intended `origin/design` commit.
3. Re-run API-backed smoke tests for statuses, blogs, jobs, listings, ads, suggestions, login, profiles, and applications.
4. Continue screenshot-led polish only when a concrete route/state is visibly inconsistent. Fix shared causes before page-specific overrides.
5. Preserve the distinct Ask Navya and bottom-right AI Assistant concepts until Mahir defines the assistant’s final purpose.

## 11. Non-negotiable hygiene

- Never use destructive Git commands or discard dirty files to obtain a clean tree.
- Never work from or import the archived Vite prototype.
- Never update old UI and active UI in parallel.
- Never solve a shared-system inconsistency with a private page fork unless a real product reason exists.
- Never call a build-only check proof of responsive correctness.
- Never hide absent API data with fabricated content.
- Never push to anything except `origin/design` without explicit approval.
- Keep commits scoped and name exactly what was verified.
